# NHL Game Outcome Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NHL (National Hockey League) games. The model analyzes various game statistics and team performance metrics to forecast the likelihood of a team winning or losing a game.

### Motivation

Predicting sports outcomes has always been of interest to sports enthusiasts, analysts, and bettors. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical data and identify patterns that contribute to game outcomes. This project explores the application of machine learning in predicting NHL game results.

### Problem Statement

Predicting the outcome of NHL games is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the sport and various influencing factors. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions for future game results.

### Dataset

I used the MoneyPuck teams dataset for training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset includes detailed information about team performance, player statistics, and game-specific features.

### Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and trends.
Model Selection: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, SVM) to determine the best model for predicting game outcomes.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model using historical data and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the outcome of NHL games for future matches.

### Requirements

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

### Future Work

Explore additional features or data sources to improve model performance.
Incorporate real-time data and update predictions for upcoming games.
Deploy the model as a web application or API for users to access predictions.
