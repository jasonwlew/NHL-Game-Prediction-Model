# NHL Game Outcome Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project, where I developed a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NHL games.

## Project Description

### Problem Statement

Predicting the outcome of NHL games is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature of the sport and various influencing factors. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions for future game results.

### Dataset

I used the MoneyPuck teams dataset for training and evaluating the machine learning model. The dataset includes detailed information about team performance, player statistics, and game-specific features.

## File Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset and any additional data used.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `src/`: Python scripts with reusable functions and modules.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
